# VGG16_cat_dog_classifier


This project is explaining about building a simple 2 class(cat or dog) classifier using VGG16 Architecture.
It uses Keras framework and we are doing here transfer learning by finetuning the pretrained VGG16 model. We are only training
the 3 Dense layer(2 nodes in last layer for 2 classes) and keeping the convolution layer weights.
